# React Front-end

Welcome to React.js! React.js is a component-based JavaScript library that allows you to easily create web applications and user interfaces with less code. We'll explain how to get started with creating your own React project!

## Getting Started

We'll begin by downloading everything we need to create a new React application.

### Windows

To use React, we first need to download Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager). You can download both from its [official website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). After downloading and installing, make sure everything is up-to-date by running these commands:

```
node -v
```

```
npm -v
```

<br>
After installing Node.js, we're ready to create our first project. Navigate to the directory you want to build your project in and run:
```
npx create-react-app my-app-name
```
<br>
Now your project is created! Navigate to the project's directory with: 
```
cd my-app-name
```
<br>
To begin running your project, use:
```
npm start 
```
<br>
Open http://localhost:3000/ in your browser to view your project.

### MacOS

To use React, we first need to download Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager). You can download both from its [official website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). After downloading and installing, make sure everything is up-to-date by running these commands in your terminal:

```
node -v
```

```
npm -v
```

<br>
After installing Node.js, we're ready to create our first project. Navigate to the directory you want to create your project in and run:
```
npx create-react-app my-app-name
```
<br>
Now your project is created! Navigate to your current project's directory with: 
```
cd my-app-name
```
<br>
To begin running your project, use:
```
npm start 
```
<br>
Open http://localhost:3000/ in your browser to view your project.
